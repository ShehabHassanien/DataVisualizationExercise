I choose to import the CO2 Emissions per capita to analyze per top 10 countries found in: https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w22

The updated dataset was downloaded from https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC?end=2014&locations=AU-BE-CA-CN-DK-DE-IN-MX-US&start=1960&view=chart to include the years up to 2016, as I noticed the graph only shows the data up to 2010
